# Support and Resistance
Support and Resistance is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on an earlier version by Barry Stander. It shows horizontal support and resistance levels based on the standard Fractals indicator.

Support and Resistance will issue alerts when price closes either above a resistance line or below a support line.
